# InstaOnTime
With this python script you'll be able to send message to a friend on a given time. You will need to provide your login info, Name of the person(Insta ID), Message and Time.    
for example: you want to wish a friend at 12:00a.m but you'll be asleep by then. Now with this script you can set time as 00:00 and send your wishes to your friend at 12:00a.m
